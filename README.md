Airport


**Text description of the topic:**

The database-based application manages the administration of an airport, from the passenger's baggage check-in, through the selection of the seat on the flight, until the seat is occupied by the passenger.


**Some key ideas:**

• The passenger can choose between available seats in a given class of a given flight (e.g. next to a window, in a non-smoking area, etc.).

• You can check in baggages up to a specified weight limit (a baggage ticket must be issued, a surcharge must be collected above the weight limit, an invoice for the surcharge must be issued, etc.).

• After boarding the aircraft, it must be checked whether all checked-in passengers have taken their seats.

• The check-in and boarding the plane are physically far from each other (border crossing and customs separate the two terminals from each other by definition).

• Handling complaints (e.g. lost luggage, etc.).
